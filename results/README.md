# SCAP Scan Results (Before & After)

This folder contains sample output from the automated SCAP hardening pipeline:

- `stig-before.html` — baseline SCAP compliance report (before remediation)
- `stig-before.arf.xml` — machine-readable baseline scan
- `stig-after.html` — compliance report after automated remediation
- `stig-after.arf.xml` — machine-readable final scan

These results demonstrate how much compliance improvement the automated remediation provides.
